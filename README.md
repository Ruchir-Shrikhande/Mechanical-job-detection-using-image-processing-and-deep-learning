The title of this project is ‘Mechanical job inspection using image processing and Deep Learning’. It aimed at identifying an inappropriate mechanical job with the potential to disrupt the production process in plants and incur massive losses to the company. The process consisted of creating and labelling each dataset which consisted of images of each mechanical job. The captured images then went through various feature extraction algorithms. After this, a deep learning algorithm called CNN (convolutional neural networks) was used for image recognition. This process consisted of various steps such as convolution operation, ReLU layer, Pooling, Flattening, Full connection and finally softmax and cross entropy. The final step was to compare the dimensions of each identified image of the mechanical job with the expected dimensions and thus identifying whether the job is fit for use or not. The final result of the project was a device which would benefit the company with shorter production time and improved selection of the product.
